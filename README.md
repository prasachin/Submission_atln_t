<strong>The application is developed using React-javascript ans CSS</strong>
<strong> Link to the application:https://submission-sachin-prakashs-projects.vercel.app/</strong>
<br>
## Introduction
The given application is developed as a task for Atlan. It enables users to run SQL queries in an online editor, and analyze the output obtained as a result of running the queries.
The detailed Problem Statement is also mentioned towards the end of this document.

## Data
The data used in the task is obtained from the website suggested in the task, which is https://github.com/graphql-compose/graphql-compose-examples/blob/master/examples/northwind/data/csv/customers.csv The "Customer" data is used in the application, and the data is downloaded and stored as a local JSON object but CSV files can also be used for the same by using a different logic, or a pre exisiting format conversion library.

## Work-flow
The application is a simple SQL editor that allows users to run SQL queries on the data provided. The application has been built using React and uses the following libraries:<br/>
* react-ace - for the SQL editor <br/>
* papaparse - for downloading the data in CSV format<br/>
* file-saver - for saving the csv file<br/>
* react-hot-toast - for providing inteeractive notification<br/>
* react-router-dom - for routing(It ensures that the application is a single page application)<br/>
* react-dom - for rendering the application<br/>
* ace-builds - for the SQL editor<br/>
* brace - for the SQL editor <br/>
and some dev-dependencies.<br/>

Users can run SQL queries on the data provided, and the output is displayed in a table format. The application also allows users to download the data in CSV format. The application is hosted on Vercel, and the link to the application is provided above.
<br/>
## Performance and Optimisation
For the Performance and Optimisation analysis, I have used Google's <strong>Lighthouse tool </strong> and Page Speed Insights to analysze the page load time, along with how well it performs as per web standards.<br/>
The Screenshots of the Performance are given below:

## How optimized the performance 
* Used <strong> React.memo </strong>: Basically a higher order component that prevents unnecessary re-renders of the component.
* Used <strong>React.lazy and React.Suspense</strong> to load the components only when they are required.   
* Used <strong>React Router</strong> to load the components only when they are required.
* Used <strong>React-ace</strong> for the SQL editor, which is a lightweight library that provides a simple and easy to use SQL editor.
* Used <strong>useCallback</strong> to memoize the functions that are passed as props to the components.Whereever possible.
* Used <strong>useMemo</strong> to memoize the values that are passed as props to the components. Whereever possible.
* Used <strong>useEffect</strong> to load the data only when the component is mounted.<br/>

# Functionality
To keep the user interactive I used some animations.But as told in the task I don't need to focus much on the UI part.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT
    Create, design and implement a web-based application capable of running SQL queries and displaying the results of said query. The application must include a space which accepts SQL queries in the form of user inputs, then runs the given query, and displays the result within the application.
    This is a dummy application.
    You must include a space to accept SQL queries. This can be as simple as a text area or as complex as a full-blown code editor. This does not figure in the judging criteria, though.
    Your application does not need to have a backend, a query engine or query validation.
    You do not need to add any syntax validation.
    The data that your application displays can be any chunk of data. It does not need to be the actual result that the query would display if it were actually run. You can choose any block of data from here or you can choose any other data source. The data and the query do not need to be in sync.
    You can write down any text as the query as you wish. The query syntax is not important, nor is the result. You are free to put in dummy stubs and mocks wherever the need arises.
    Your application must have more than one query accompanied by its corresponding table of data. You can have a predefined set of queries and a predefined set of tables showing some data. You must also provide a way for us to toggle between these queries and choose any query and view the table of data accompanying it. It can be a dropdown or any other toggling mechanism.
    This is not a design-centric role, nor will you ever be asked to design any part of the product if you end up joining us.
    In this stage, scribble out a rough layout of your webpage. Decide where the blocks of your application will go. You will not be judged on the basis of your design proficiency. This part mainly tests your ability to predict your userâ€™s behaviour, anticipate how they would use your product and the way you go about enhancing the user flow or the user experience.
